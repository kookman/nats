# nats
A basic [Nats](http://nats.io) client library for Dlang, built on vibe.d

Aims to allow high-performance zero copy message processing, and minimal GC allocation
generated by the library itself in the "hot loop" (ie normal message receipt and processing).

For this reason, the `NatsHandlers` receive the `Msg` struct as a `scope` parameter,
and currently all message processing is handled synchronously in the eventloop (main) thread,
to avoid unnecessary copying of `Msg` structs onto the GC heap. This also matches with (my)
typical deployment profile of small, single purpose processes with a single message processing
thread, optimized for minimal latency message processing. 

If necessary for blocking IO or more computate intensive tasks that might otherwise block the 
event/message processing loop, you can copy the data required from the `Msg` struct, and
send it to a task(fibre) or another thread. See example in the `query_responder` in the 
test app (`src/app.d`).


Current features supported:
- [x] Implement SUB api
- [x] Implement PUB api
- [x] Implement flush logic
- [x] Implement request-response subscriptions
- [x] Support proper connect options
- [x] Support reconnect logic
- [x] Support large messages
- [x] Support distributed queues (subscriber groups)
- [x] Disconnect/clean shutdown
- [ ] Support Nats 2.0 Nkey-based authentication
- [ ] Support HPUB/HMSG (Nats message headers)
- [ ] ? Add support for Jetstream (perhaps belongs in a separate module from the basic client)
- [ ] ? Support (de)serialisation protocols: msgpack, cerealed, none (passthru ubyte[])

For example usage, see the test app (`src/app.d`).
