# nats
A basic [Nats](http://nats.io) client library for Dlang, built on vibe.d

Aims to allow zero copy message processing, and close to zero GC generated by the library 
itself in the "hot loop" (ie normal message receipt and processing).

For this reason, the `NatsHandlers` receive the `Msg` struct as a `scope` parameter,
and currently all message processing is handled synchronously, to avoid unnecessary
copying of `Msg` structs on the GC heap.

Current features supported:

 |*| Implement SUB api
 |*| Implement PUB api
 |*| Implement flush logic
 |*| Implement request-response subscriptions
 |*| Support proper connect options
 |*| Support reconnect logic
 |*| Support large messages
 |*| Support distributed queues (subscriber groups)
 | | ? Support (de)serialisation protocols: msgpack, cerealed, none (passthru ubyte[])

For example usage, see the test app (`src/app.d`).
